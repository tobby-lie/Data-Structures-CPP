--------------------------
Asymptotic Analysis
for functions of myVector
class
--------------------------

----------
Operator[]
----------
O(1)
This is constant order as it is
not dependent on any size. It is just
returning a variable at one specific
index.
--------
pop_back
--------
C+n+n
= O(n)
Although there is a conditional statement
and there is more than one loop, this function
still falls under n order, simply because there
are no nested loops. The highest order of
complexity is for the second for loop which
still follows n order. For this reason we
drop any constants and approximate all smaller
values to the larger.
---------
push_back
---------
C+n+n
= O(n)
Similar to pop_back, this function utilizes a
conditional statement and two for loops however
the highest order of n is observed when performing
an asymptotic analysis.
------
search
------
O(n)
Since a linear search was utilized, it would make
sense that the worst case for this search would be
an order of n. Meaning it is linear with respect to
the total number of elements in the given array
if there were 8 elements total, then there would
be 8 total searches possible in a worst case.
