--------------------------
Asymptotic Analysis
for functions of LinkedList
--------------------------

---------------
insertAtFront()
---------------
O(1)+O(1)+O(1)+O(1)+O(1)
= O(5) = O(1)
This function does not include any
loops. Just simple lines of code that
fall under constant order. Therefore
this is constant order. 
---------------
insertAtBack()
---------------
O(n)+O(9)
= O(n)
This function includes a while loop which
depends on the number of elements in the list.
This means that it is an order of n meaning
that the worst case is dependent on how many
elements there are in the list. There other
lines of code but all fall under constant order
in Big O we are concerned about the highest
order which in this case is O(n) after all
constants are dropped.
